            <p>
              I am a Business Information and Technology student, at St Paul’s
              University in Nairobi Kenya, currently awaiting graduation.
              Through this course, I was able to gain interest in web
              development as I did some practice as part of my coursework.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a dedicated, methodical, and organized individual with
              excellent communication abilities. I am great at developing
              innovative solutions to problems and advocating for a win-win
              situation. I'm always keen to learn new things and face new
              difficulties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fun fact! I am a very creative individual as I am blessed with an
              artistic side. As part of my part time activities I engage in
              woodworking, upholstery, hairdressing or garment construction
              amongst many others as they let me exercise my creative side. This
              also translates into my web development journey as the front-end
              aspect of it triggers my creativity. Therefore, having an
              opportunity to create something beautiful from scratch gives me
              joy.

            <h3>My first Portfolio</h3>
            <p>
              This project was my first attempt at creating a portfolio and
              linking it to GitHub. I managed to work with bootstrap and
              appreciate the work of fellow programmers as most of the codes
              were borrowed.

            <h3>Building a Terrarium</h3>
            <p>
              This project was carried out during my sessions with front-End
              Foxes. It gave me an opportunity to work with javascript and see
              how it enables interaction. This is seen through the dragging of
              the plant elements into the jar.

            <h3>Pet Adoption System</h3>
            <p>
              This is a project I am currently undertaking. The idea at hand is
              to create a pet adoption system. This will create a platform where
              pet owners will be able to sell or donate their pets to loving
              homes and people looking for pets can be able to spot them easily.
